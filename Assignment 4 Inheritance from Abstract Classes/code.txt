/* Program Statement
*This program will calculate the tax from the inputted gross
income of an individual alongside with the individual's salary after the tax reduction
From assignment sheet
"Write a program to read a person's name, filing status, and taxable income and write their state income tax.
Verify salary (positive numbers only) and status (can only be joint or single), if invalid data is entered terminate
the program with an error message. Pay special attention as how the tax is calculated."
*
***Analysis***

Data needed

**How much tax is deducted within a range of gross salary
How much money a single individual makes for single taxes
How much money individuals make for joint taxes
The name of the individual


Constants Given

Computed tax formula for various of ranges of Gross Salaries

Calculations

Assumptions

All numbers are assumed to be positive integers
The heading of our name and programming assignment is assumed to be in each printout
The user will input 'S','s','J','j' for filing status


Calculate

Calculate the amount of taxes owed after user inputs gross salary
Calculate net salary from the gross salary and taxes

Print Results

Name of the Individual
Filing Status of their tax form
Gross Salary of the Individual
Taxes that they owe (income tax)
Salary after taxes (net salary)
***End of Analysis***

***Algorithm***
Input
Prompt user for their full name
Prompt user for their taxable income(gross salary)
Prompt user for their filing status (they enter either J(Joint) or S(Single))

Process
Verification

we discussed this, it could be either in input or verification 
*
If user inputs their taxable income that isn't a positive integer
Print error described - income isn't a positive integer
Prompt user for taxable income(gross salary) again

If user inputs a character not 'S','s','J','j'
Print error described- status isn't S/s/J /j
Prompt user for filing status again
*

If filing status is single (using 'S' or 's'):
(Gross Salary > 0 and Gross Salary < 1710)
income tax = 0
Net Salary = Gross Salary - (income tax)

(Gross Salary > 1710 and Gross Salary < 20930)

income tax = 87.00 + (.03)(Gross Salary - 1710)
Net Salary = Gross Salary - (income tax)

(Gross Salary > 20930 and Gross Salary < 28790)

income tax = 742.00 + (.08)(Gross Salary - 20930)
Net Salary = Gross Salary - (income tax)

(Gross Salary > 28790)

income tax = 1449.60 + (.11)(Gross Salary - 28790)
Net Salary = Gross Salary - (income tax)

If filing status is joint(using 'J' or 'j'):
(Gross Salary > 0 and Gross Salary < 3420)

income tax = 0
Net Salary = Gross Salary - (income tax)

(Gross Salary > 3420 and Gross Salary < 47120)

income tax = 330.00 + (.04)(Gross Salary - 3420)
Net Salary = Gross Salary - (income tax)

(Gross Salary > 47120 and Gross Salary < 57580)

income tax = 1905.00 + (.09)(Gross Salary - 47120)
Net Salary = Gross Salary - (income tax)

(Gross Salary > 57580)

income tax = 2899.20 + (.11)(Gross Salary - 57580)
Net Salary = Gross Salary - (income tax)
